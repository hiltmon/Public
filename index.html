            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <p>ETFs and Funds only get you so far. Optimized for mass distribution, but are optimized for mass distribution and have perpetual duration.</p>
            <p>Owning bonds enables your advisor to customize a portfolio tailored to your savings horizon and risk preference. You can lock in your yield to maturity, and enjoy the transparency and predictability of cash flows. Importantly, you may have significant flexibility to realize tax losses.</p>
            <p>Owning bonds has been historically out of reach for most investors due to the costs involved to trade, until now. Algo liquidity has transformed the market from manual to electronic, and so too now how you access the market. </p>
